Good day, sir. I am Kervy N. Cadiente from BSIT 2A, and this is my app project. 
I apologize if this is all I was able to accomplish, but I did my best with what I’ve learned so far.

Despite the challenges, working on this project was a fun experience. 
It helped me discover not just what I’m capable of, 
but also made me more aware of my strengths and the areas where I still need to improve.

Thankyou so much sir.
